    string itemdesc[15]={"ADVANCED ROCK\n\nA rock is a solid mass of geological materials. Geological materials include individual mineral crystals, inorganic non-mineral solids like glass, pieces broken from other rocks, and even fossils. The geological materials in rocks may be inorganic, but they can also include organic materials such as the partially decomposed plant matter preserved in coal. A rock can be composed of only one type of geological material or mineral, but many are composed of several types.\n\nGAMEPLAY: DESTROYS SCISSORS, DESTROYED BY PAPER","ADVANCED PAPER\n\nPaper is a thin sheet material produced by mechanically or chemically processing cellulose fibres derived from wood, rags, grasses or other vegetable sources in water, draining the water through fine mesh leaving the fibre evenly distributed on the surface, followed by pressing and drying. It is a versatile material with many uses, including printing, packaging, decorating, writing, cleaning, filter paper, wallpaper, book endpaper, conservation paper, laminated worktops, toilet tissue, currency and security paper and a number of industrial and construction processes.\n\nGAMEPLAY: DESTROYS ROCK, DESTROYED BY SCISSORS","ADVANCED SCISSORS\n\nScissors are hand-operated shearing tools. A pair of scissors consists of a pair of metal blades pivoted so that the sharpened edges slide against each other when the handles (bows) opposite to the pivot are closed. Scissors are used for cutting various thin materials, such as paper, cardboard, metal foil, cloth, rope, and wire. A large variety of scissors and shears all exist for specialized purposes.\n\nGAMEPLAY: DESTROYS PAPER, DESTROYED BY ROCK","BEANIE\n\na beanie is a head-hugging brimless cap, made from triangular panels of material joined by a button at the crown and seamed together around the sides. Commonly made of cloth or felt material, beanies may also be made from leather or silk. In some US regions and parts of Canada the term beanie refers to a knitted cap (often woollen), alternately called a stocking cap or toque\n\nNO GAMEPLAY","WIG\n\nA wig is a head or hair accessory made from human hair, animal hair, or synthetic fiber.[1] The word wig is short for periwig,[2] which makes its earliest known appearance in the English language in William Shakespeare's The Two Gentlemen of Verona. Some people wear wigs to disguise baldness; a wig may be used as a less intrusive and less expensive alternative to medical therapies for restoring hair or for a religious reason.\n\nNO GAMEPLAY","HELMET\n\nA helmet is a form of protective gear worn to protect the head. More specifically, a helmet complements the skull in protecting the human brain. Ceremonial or symbolic helmets (e.g., a policeman's helmet in the United Kingdom) without protective function are sometimes worn. Soldiers wear combat helmets, often made from Kevlar or other lightweight synthetic fibers.\n\nNO GAMEPLAY","SHIRT\n\nA shirt is a cloth garment for the upper body (from the neck to the waist).\n\nNO GAMEPLAY","DRESS SHIRT\n\nA dress shirt, button shirt, button-front, button-front shirt, or button-up shirt is a garment with a collar and a full-length opening at the front, which is fastened using buttons or shirt studs. A button-down or button-down shirt is a dress shirt which has a button-down collar â€“ a collar having the ends fastened to the shirt with buttons.\n\nNO GAMEPLAY","KHAKIS\n\nKhaki has been used by many armies around the world for uniforms, including camouflage. It has been used as a color name in English since 1848 when it was first introduced as a military uniform.[1] In Western fashion, it is a standard color for smart casual dress trousers for civilians, which are also often called khakis.\n\nNO GAMEPLAY","SKIRT\n\nA skirt is the lower part of a dress or a separate outer garment that covers a person from the waist downwards.\n\nNO GAMEPLAY","CROCS\n\nThe shoe was originally developed as a boating shoe. The first model produced by Crocs, the Beach, was unveiled in 2001 at the Fort Lauderdale Boat Show in Florida, and the 200 pairs that they had produced were all sold.[10] Crocs has since sold 300 million pairs of shoes.[11] In June 2020, Crocs moved the headquarters from Niwot, Colorado to Broomfield.\n\nNO GAMEPLAY","SNEAKERS\n\nSneakers (also called trainers, athletic shoes, tennis shoes, gym shoes, kicks, sport shoes, flats, running shoes, skate shoes, or runners) are shoes primarily designed for sports or other forms of physical exercise, but which are now also widely used for everyday casual wear.\n\nNO GAMEPLAY","SLIPPERS\n\nSlippers are light footwear that are easy to put on and off and are intended to be worn indoors, particularly at home.[1] They provide comfort and protection for the feet when walking indoors.\n\nNO GAMEPLAY","WRIST WATCH\n\nA watch is a portable timepiece intended to be carried or worn by a person. It is designed to keep a consistent movement despite the motions caused by the person's activities. A wristwatch is designed to be worn around the wrist, attached by a watch strap or other type of bracelet, including metal bands, leather straps or any other kind of bracelet.\n\nNO GAMEPLAY","SUNGLASSES\n\nSunglasses or sun glasses (informally called shades or sunnies; more names below) are a form of protective eyewear designed primarily to prevent bright sunlight and high-energy visible light from damaging or discomforting the eyes. They can sometimes also function as a visual aid, as variously termed spectacles or glasses exist, featuring lenses that are colored, polarized or darkened. In the early 20th century, they were also known as sun cheaters (cheaters then being an American slang term for glasses)\n\nNO GAMEPLAY"};
